### Review and Programming Tutorial: TADA68

Review, screenshots, and instructions on how to load new FLASH.BIN files:

  > - Press button on the bottom of the board; if you turn it over, it’s on the right side, or under the left side if the board’s right-side up.  This will cause the backlights to start flashing.
  > - NOTE: THE KEYBOARD IS UNUSABLE AT THIS POINT.
  > - Find your FLASH.BIN file that you downloaded and copy it.
  > - You may have noticed that when you pushed the button, a new drive will have connected to your PC; that’s the TADA68’s storage.  If you open it, there’s a FLASH.BIN file in there.  Oh.
  > - Great idea, thanks to anonymous commenter: create a copy of the original FLASH.BIN file so you’ll always have a copy, just in case.
  > - Delete that file.  Paste your new FLASH.BIN file in its place.
  >   - (Note: if you just try to paste over it, you’ll get a warning that there isn’t enough space for the file operation.  You have to delete it.  I made the leap of faith, you can too.)
  > - Press the ESC key; this will restart the TADA68 (literally takes a second), and your new mappings should be live.

    > I was recently annoyed by having no translation when trying to program the fn key on my new tada68, so popped over to [/r/translator](https://www.reddit.com/r/translator) and my good friend, [/u/kschang](https://www.reddit.com/u/kschang), was able to help me out. I know some other people were having this issue so I figured I'd share.
